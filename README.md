# New_PasteBin

## Purpose ##
Our semester project will be creating our version of PasteBin. The reason we chose this is because the current PasteBin has gotten too bulky and doesn't have any searching capabilities. Thus, our purpose is to make it less clunky (minimalistic), be more search-friendly, and overall just add some new features (display, user authentication, security, and many more).

## Tech Stack ##
